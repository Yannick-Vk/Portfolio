A portfolio website created using **Astro** and **TypeScript** to showcase my projects and skills.
The website features a clean and modern design, with sections for my bio, skills, projects, and contact information.
The project is structured to be easily maintainable and scalable, allowing for the addition of new projects and updates
to my skills as needed.

The project uses Astro's server-side rendering capabilities to ensure fast load times and optimal performance.
The project uses Markdown files to manage project content,
making it easy to add or update projects without modifying the core codebase.

The UI is buildt with **React** components integrated into the Astro framework and **Shadcn** UI components,
providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.
