Created a simple task board application using **React**. For styling, I used **Tailwind CSS**. 
All UI and components are written without a UI library.

The app allows users to add, remove, and edit tasks.

This project is still a work in progress, but it demonstrates the basics of managing state and rendering components in
React.

The tasks are saved via a **.Net** web api and **GraphQL** in a **Postgres** database running on **docker**.

## Current Features

- Add Task
- Remove Task
- Edit Task status (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Edit Task Name with a Modal

## Future Plans & Improvements

- [x] Save tasks to a database via a **GraphQL** API
- [ ] Filter tasks by status
- [ ] Add priority (low, medium high)
- [ ] Add createdOn date
- [ ] Add an optional due-date

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- GraphQL
- Docker
- PostgresSQL
