Created a simple task board application using **React**. For styling, I used **Tailwind CSS**.

The app allows users to add, remove, and edit tasks.

This project is still a work in progress, but it demonstrates the basics of managing state and rendering components in
React.

Currently, the tasks are not saved to local storage or a database, but this is planned for future updates.

## Current Features

- Add Task
- Remove Task
- Edit Task status (To Do, In Progress, Done)

## Future Improvements

- Save tasks to local storage
- Save tasks to a database via a **GraphQL** API
- Filter tasks by status

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- GraphQL (planned)
